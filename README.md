# Movies ETL
## Overview of the Project
### Purpose
The Amazing Prime video team would like to develop an algorithm to predict which low budget movies being released will become popular so that they can buy the streaming rights at a bargain. Amazing Prime wants to keep the dataset updated on a daily basis. They desire to create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables. I thereby created one function that takes in the three files, Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data, and performed the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database.
